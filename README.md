Welcome to the Big Mama browser version repository!

For the uninitiated, Big Mama was originally a text-based command-line game for Node.js. I am "porting" Big Mama to the web to share with friends and family.

Big Mama is a turn-based game where you traverse through a corridor. Every turn, you have a chance to win an item... or run into Big Mama. If you run into Big Mama, you will have to fight her to escape! You must traverse a certain number of spaces in order to win the game and escape Big Mama's clutches.

The project history is a bit disorganized due to me not being sure how I wanted to organize the original Big Mama project once I wanted a web version. All future work on Big Mama will be done here.
